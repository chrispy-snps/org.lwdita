# Add, remove, or edit menu items in your online store {#add-remove-or-edit-menu-items-in-your-online-store}

============================ You can add menu items to your online store menus to build your store's navigation. Menu items are links to products, collections, webpages, blog posts, policies, or other websites. You can also remove or edit menu items.

In most cases, you need to create an item before you can link to it. For example, you need to [create a collection](manual/products/collections) before you can add it to a menu.

You can view and change your online store navigation from the [**Navigation**](/www.shopify.com/admin/menus) page in your Shopify admin.
